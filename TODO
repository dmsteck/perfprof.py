Get rid of floating point arange

Add support for fixing tiny relative errors

Clarify/fix behaviour for NaNs/zeroes. In principle the ratios should
be computed as follows:
0 / 0 = 1
>0 / 0 = inf
inf / >=0 = inf
inf / inf = inf (maybe)

Split main function (e.g., maxTheta, minValues, makeStaircase and plotProfile)
and add doctests/unit tests for all of them

Simplify staircase building

add REQUIREMENTS
